Logical Rules: It applies logical rules to ensure each person belongs to exactly one house and each house has exactly one person assigned to it.
Given Constraints: The script incorporates given constraints such as specific assignments for certain characters.
Model Checking: It utilizes a function to check if the logical knowledge base satisfies specific symbols, indicating whether certain assignments are valid.

Usage
